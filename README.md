This report utilizes historical Small Business Administration (SBA) loan data to develop predictive models aimed at determining the likelihood of loan repayment or default. The dataset consists of 899,164 rows and 27 columns of historical information spanning multiple decades. The primary objective is to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions about loan approvals by maximizing profits and minimizing losses through data-driven insights. By analyzing loan repayment probabilities, the project seeks to identify the most effective classification methods for predicting loan outcomes, incorporating key profitability metrics and risk considerations.

This report will evaluate and compare five different classification models: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification Trees, and Discriminant Analysis. These models will be assessed not only based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, but also considering profit metrics to ensure that the models contribute to maximizing profitability. The evaluation process will guide key decisions on feature selection, model thresholds, and evaluation metrics to enhance prediction accuracy and optimize business results for stakeholders.

We also created a GitHub repository which provides detailed documentation, code for each classification model, and additional resources for replicating the analysis and exploring the dataset. Researchers and stakeholders are encouraged to review the repository for deeper insights and to build upon our work.
