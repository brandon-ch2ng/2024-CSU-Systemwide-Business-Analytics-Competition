We have provided a video demonstration on how to use the model effectively. In summary, the process begins by uploading your data into a data cleaning notebook, where the dataset is preprocessed and prepared for model input. After cleaning and transforming the data, the model processes it to predict whether the bank should approve or reject a loan application. The final output includes both the decision—'Approve' or 'Reject'—as well as the probability associated with each decision, providing valuable insights for loan approval processes.
